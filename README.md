# Coursera_Capstone
For IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Course 9
The theme of this captston project is to determine the best neighbourhoods around a new work location in Toronto, based on our simulated preferences and familiarity around our initial home in Toronto.

For me, this project is is meant to bring together everything I have learned over the last 8 courses in the program, over the last 10 days.
